### meetup-apollo-client

Sample project intended as an interactive illustration for `@apollo/client` docs

Naive implementation, is not production-ready

#### How to use

- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start server and client.
- Run `docker-compose run server yarn seed` to seed some sample data.
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Explore different examples listed in the sidebar, observe cache changes in Apollo Devtools, watch network, etc.

Both server and client are in watch mode, feel free to modify code iin runtime
